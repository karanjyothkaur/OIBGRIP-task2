                        Guru Nanak, also referred to as Baba Nanak, was the founder of Sikhism and is the first of the ten Sikh Gurus.
                        His birth is celebrated worldwide as Guru Nanak Gurpurab on Katak Pooranmashi, i.e. Octoberâ€“November. 
                        The festival is celebrated on the day of Kartik Poornima, 
                        which is the fifteenth lunar day in the month of Kartik according to the Hindu calendar, 
                        and usually falls in the month of November by the Gregorian calendar. 
                        The mool mantra given by Sri Guru Nanak Dev is: 
                        "Ik Onkar, Satnam, Karta Purakh, Nirbhau, Nirvair, Akal Murat, Ajuni Sae Bham, Guru Prasad."
                        This means: There's only one God, his name is the only truth,
                        he is the only creator, he is fearless, he is without hate, he is immortal,
                        he is beyond birth and death, and by only his grace one can chant his name.
